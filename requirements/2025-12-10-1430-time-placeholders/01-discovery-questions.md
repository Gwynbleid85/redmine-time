# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Should time placeholders appear in the same calendar/daily views alongside Redmine time entries?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users need a unified view to see total monthly time)

## Q2: Should each placeholder type (Doctor, Vacation, Holiday) have a default duration (e.g., 8 hours for a full day)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (8 hours default makes sense for full-day absences)

## Q3: Should users be able to add custom placeholder types beyond Doctor, Vacation, and Holiday?
**Default if unknown:** No (keep it simple with the three predefined types initially)

## Q4: Should placeholders be visually distinguished from real Redmine entries (e.g., different color/badge)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users need to quickly identify what's synced vs local-only)

## Q5: Should the monthly totals summary show a breakdown of Redmine time vs placeholder time?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (transparency helps users understand their tracked vs non-tracked time)
