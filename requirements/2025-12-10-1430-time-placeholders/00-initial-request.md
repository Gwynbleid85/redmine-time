# Initial Request

## User Request
The new functionality should add time placeholders, that will be saved in db per user but will not propagate to redmine. This will help users to get overall time per month. Types of placeholder: Doctor, vacation, holiday

## Key Points
- Time placeholders (not real Redmine time entries)
- Stored in local database per user
- NOT synced to Redmine
- Purpose: Track overall monthly time including non-work activities
- Placeholder types:
  - Doctor
  - Vacation
  - Holiday
