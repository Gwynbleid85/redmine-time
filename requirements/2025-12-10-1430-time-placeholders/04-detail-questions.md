# Detail Questions

## Q1: Should users be able to add a placeholder directly from the "Add Task" button, or should there be a separate "Add Placeholder" button?
**Default if unknown:** Separate button (keeps the workflows distinct and avoids confusion)

## Q2: Should placeholders support editing after creation (change date, duration, type)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users may make mistakes or need to adjust)

## Q3: Should the placeholder dialog allow selecting a date range for multi-day entries (e.g., 5 vacation days), or require adding each day individually?
**Default if unknown:** Individual days (simpler implementation, consistent with time entries)

## Q4: When a day has less than 8 hours (shown in red), should placeholder hours count toward making it "green" (8+ hours)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the goal is to show total monthly time including non-work)

## Q5: Should there be a way to quickly add common placeholders (e.g., "Add full day vacation" button)?
**Default if unknown:** No (keep UI simple, defaults already handle common cases)
